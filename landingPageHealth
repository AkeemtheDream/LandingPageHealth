    <h3> What should I be eating?</h3>
    <p1> There are many different approaches when it comes to eating the right
      tings for your health. First & foremost are your goals. SOme people are
      looking to lose weight, while others are looking to gain. Some people have
      allergies and others don't. As a general rule of thumb a <strong><em>plant
      based diet </strong></em>as that is most universal & is a good starting point
      for health regardless of your individual goal as all health goals include
      getting...well... healthier.</p1>
